              C is a mid-level structured oriented programming language, used in
              general-purpose programming, developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T
              Bell Labs, the USA, between 1969 and 1973.
            </p>

            <h1>Why Learn C?</h1>
            <ul class="lists">
              <li>
                It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you know C, you will have no problem to learn other popular
                programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the
                syntax is similar.
              </li>
              <li>
                C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like
                Java and Python.
              </li>
              <li>
                C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and
                technologies.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Difference between C and C++</h1>
            <ul class="lists">
              <li>
                C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have
                almost the same syntax.
              </li>
              <li>
                The main diffference between C and C++ is that C++ support
                classes and objects, while C does not.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Get_Started_with_C">
          <header>Get Started with C</header>
          <article>
            <p>To start using C, you need two things:</p>
            <ul class="lists">
              <li>A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code</li>
              <li>
                A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language
                that the computer will understand
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this
              tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below).
            </p>
            <h1>C Install IDE</h1>
            <p>
              An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND
              compile the code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.
              These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C
              code.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Note:</b> Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality
              is limited.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will use <b>Code::Blocks</b> in our tutorial, which we believe
              is a good place to start.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at
              <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26."
                >http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26.</a
              >
              Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text
              editor with a compiler.
            </p>
            <h1>C Quickstart</h1>
            <p>Let's create our first C file.</p>
            <ul class="lists">
              <li>
                <p>
                  Open Codeblocks and go to

          <header>Comments in C</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              Comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more
              readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing
              alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.
            </p>
            <h2>Single-line Comments</h2>
            <p>
              Single-line comments start with two forward slashes
              <code>//</code>.

              As explained in the Variables chapter, a variable in C must be a
